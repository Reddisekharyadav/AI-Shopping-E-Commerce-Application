### Can't Find "Add to Home Screen" (iPhone)

**Make sure you're using Safari**
- The install feature only works in Safari on iOS
- Chrome/Firefox on iPhone don't support this

**Look for the Share button**
- It's at the bottom center of Safari

### App Not Syncing Data

**Check internet connection**
